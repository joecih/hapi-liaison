## Simple application showing the use of HapiJS, AngularJS, and material-design-lite.

### Business Requirement

We need an application that takes manual input of a GitHub user’s name and displays relevant
information regarding their account. If the username is not found, the UI should display a
message about it. Furthermore, the UI should display an error if the input field is empty and the
user tries to submit. We enjoy a good easter egg, so if the user types in the username “Brad”, it
should display a Simpson’s reference.

### Functional Requirements
- The application should be built using NodeJS, feel free to use a framework such as HapiJS or Express
- Use AngularJS (1.x) for the front-end application
- If the input field is left empty and the user tries to submit, display error
- If the username is not found, display an error
- If the username is “Brad”, display a simpson’s quote above the relevant return.
- Format the GitHub return into an acceptable format the UI can display (your preference on look and what’s displayed)
